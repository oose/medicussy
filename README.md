# Medicussy
Risk analysis for medical devices based on the OMG RAAML specification

## Medical devices domain characteristics

- Significant documentation effort to gain certification
- Today, document driven development approach 
- Risk management (RM) activities are a cost driver
- Lack of standardized methods and practices to qualify medical equipment
- RM information-wise decoupled from engineering 

## Objectives of this project
- Provide a standard based method implementation for RM
- Enable integration of RM into engineering activities
- Comply with RAAML language and philosophy
- Enable MBSE
